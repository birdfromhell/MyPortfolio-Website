# Planned Updates

Here are the updates planned for bolstering the website:

## Migrating to React Framework

The website will be migrated from static HTML to the React framework. This is done for several reasons.

* To utilize the component-based architecture provided by React for improved code maintainability and readability.
* To take advantage of Reactâ€™s Virtual DOM and other optimizations for better performance.
* To integrate with modern front-end tools and practices like Webpack, Babel, and JSX.
* To prepare for potential future enhancements which may utilize dynamic content and interactivity provided by a JavaScript framework.

The implementation process involves:

1. Setting up a new development environment using Create React App.
2. Converting each of the major UI blocks of the website into individual React components.
3. Testing each component thoroughly during and after the transition process.

## Building a Backend

A custom backend will be built to serve the website, replacing the current static hosting. The primary motivations for this undertaking are:

* To implement dynamic content and features in future updates, requiring server-side logic.
* To add a proper CMS (Content Management System) for easier updates and management of the content shown on the website.
* To introduce data analytics and performance monitoring, by logging visits, interactions, errors, and latencies on the server side.

The implementation process encompasses:

1. Choosing an appropriate backend tech stack. Node.js with Express.js or Python with Django are possible choices.
2. Designing and implementing the server-side logic required to serve the current website content.
3. Building a CMS for managing the website content, if not available out of the box with the chosen tech stack.
4. Testing the backend thoroughly during and after the development process.

These changes represent a significant upgrade to the current website. They will enable easier management, better potential for future enhancements, and provide an improved user experience. Implementation will be handled with care to prevent disruption to the current website during the transition.
